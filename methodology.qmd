## Steps taken:

1.  Creating new shapefile layer to map out the location of MRT exits of the new Thomson-East Coast line MRT stations

2.  Extracting out the walkways and pathways people can take

3.  Using Iso-area as polygon to delineate the catchment area around these MRT stations.

4.  Classify the areas based on 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes and 20 minutes walks, based on a walking speed of 4.44 km/h. 

5.  Identify the land use of the catchment areas by analysing the Master Plan 2019.

6.  Identify the types of buildings by analysing the OpenStreetMap buildings layer. Generated the centroids of the buildings in order to select the buildings within the iso-area using the \'Select by location\' function. By selecting these centroids, we are able to select the actual buildings within the iso-areas.

7.  Identify the places of interests in the catchment area by analysing the OpenStreetMap POIS layer. Select the POIS within the iso-areas using the \'Select by location\' function.

8.  Labelling the POIS with SVG symbols, based on the type of POIS.

The datasets used are:

1.  Master Plan 2019 Rail Station Layer from data.gov.sg. This dataset gives us the locations of the MRT stations that are estimated to be done by 2023.

2.  Master Plan 2019 Land Use from data.gov.sg. This dataset shows the projected land use of Singapore by 2023.

3.  Roads and buildings data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets, downloaded from  [Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei](https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html) at Geofabrik download server.

Locating MRT exits

The first step we did was to map out the MRT station exits. This data could not be found online. The only dataset that was provided on data.gov.sg was the Master Plan 2019 Rail Station layer, which showed the indicative MRT station outlines. However, we felt that the outlines were not enough to give us accurate results since one MRT station can have up to five different exits which may serve very different purposes. Hence, by creating a new shapefile, we toggled editing and marked out the location of the MRT exits. We referenced lta.gov.sg to obtain the location of the exits of each station.

Extracting relevant roads from OSM Roads layer

Since our project only focuses on the immediate catchment area of each station, we were only concerned with the areas within 20 minutes of walking distance. Hence, we extracted all the roads that allowed users to walk on. We had to exclude expressways, filtering out Motorway, Motorway Links, Truckway and Truckway links. After extracting out the roads, we created a new layer to form our network layer and ensure all the roads we linked.
