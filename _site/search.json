First open to passengers in 1987, the MRT had actually been a long time coming, with planning done as early as the 1960s. The main objective of building the MRT was to have a better road network for Singaporeans and create a more efficient public transport system to cope with the increasing population.Â \nIn 1972, a team of consultants and officers start the SG Mass Transit study, in which they recommended an investment in public transport to cope with the travel demands and avoid traffic congestion as it started to worsen. In the second phase, they recommended a bus-rail system rather than an all-bus system. However, it was a dilemma because constructing an MRT system had high costs, impacts on land use and economic activities. 1982, goc found that SG would benefit greatly from an MRT system and decided to build and finance the $5 billion project."

Generated the centroids of the buildings in order to select the buildings within the iso-area using the 'Select by location' function. By selecting these centroids, we are able to select the actual buildings within the iso-areas.\nIdentify the places of interests in the catchment area by analysing the OpenStreetMap POIS layer. Select the POIS within the iso-areas using the 'Select by location' function.\nLabelling the POIS with SVG symbols, based on the type of POIS.\n\n\n\nThe datasets used are:\n\nMaster Plan 2019 Rail Station Layer from data.gov.sg. This dataset gives us the locations of the MRT stations that are estimated to be done by 2023.\nMaster Plan 2019 Land Use from data.gov.sg. This dataset shows the projected land use of Singapore by 2023.\nRoads and buildings data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets, downloaded fromÂ  Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei at Geofabrik download server.\n\n\n\nLocating MRT exits\nThe first step we did was to map out the MRT station exits. This data could not be found online. The only dataset that was provided on data.gov.sg was the Master Plan 2019 Rail Station layer, which showed the indicative MRT station outlines. However, we felt that the outlines were not enough to give us accurate results since one MRT station can have up to five different exits which may serve very different purposes. Hence, by creating a new shapefile, we toggled editing and marked out the location of the MRT exits. We referenced lta.gov.sg to obtain the location of the exits of each station.\n\n\n\n\nExtracting relevant roads from OSM Roads layer\nSince our project only focuses on the immediate catchment area of each station, we were only concerned with the areas within 20 minutes of walking distance. Hence, we extracted all the roads that allowed users to walk on. We had to exclude expressways, filtering out Motorway, Motorway Links, Truckway and Truckway links. After extracting out the roads, we created a new layer to form our network layer and ensure all the roads we linked.\n\n\nCreating Iso-area as polygon"
