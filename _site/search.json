This dataset gives us the locations of the MRT stations that are estimated to be done by 2023.\nMaster Plan 2019 Land Use from data.gov.sg. This dataset shows the projected land use of Singapore until 2023.\nRoads, buildings and places of interest data (labelled as POIS) from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets, downloaded from Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei which is located in the Geofabrik download server.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data we have retrieved from data.gov.sg, we were able to obtain the shapefile for the MRT stations (existing and future stations). Using the Select features function, we filtered out only the 7 MRT stations of the Thomson-East Coast line that we will be analysing. All the selected stations were saved into a Geopackage, TEL_MRTStations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step we did was to map out the MRT station exits. This data could not be found online. The only dataset that was provided on data.gov.sg was the Master Plan 2019 Rail Station layer, which showed the indicative MRT station outlines. However, we felt that the outlines were not enough to give us accurate results since one MRT station can have up to five different exits which may serve very different purposes. Hence, by creating a new shapefile, we toggled editing and marked out the location of the MRT exits. We referenced lta.gov.sg to obtain the location of the exits of each station. We then created new shapefile layers of point geometry type and toggled editing to add in the point features where the MRT exits are located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our project only focuses on the immediate catchment area of each station, we were only concerned with the areas within 20 minutes of walking distance. Hence, we extracted all the roads that allowed users to walk on. We had to exclude expressways by filtering out Motorway, Motorway Links, Truckway and Truckway links. After extracting out the roads, we created a new layer to form our network layer and ensure all the roads we linked.\n\nSelect the osm_roads_free_1.shp from your file\n\nAfter the layer is loaded, select “select Features by Polygon” from the header.\n\nCrop out the designated area of Singapore, to reduce processing power.\n\nSave the layer in a Geopackage named SG Roads.\n\n\nUsing the expression above, we selected motorway, motorway_link, trunk and trunk_link from osm roads (which are expressways), which are the paths that pedestrians cannot walk on.\n\nWe proceeded to invert the features selected from above. The remaining paths will form the roads with walking paths available, thus making it an important aspect of our catchment area study.\n\nScreenshot above shows all the walking paths in Singapore that are applicable to our study.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we will use TE23 (Tanjong Rhu) MRT station as an example for the methods used to generate iso-areas. The blue pointers indicate the exit points of the station and the lines surrounding it indicate the walking paths.\n\nGo to Processing toolbox -> QNEAT 3 -> select Iso-Area as Polygons (from layer).\n\n\nSteps taken in the screenshots above:\n\nSelecting the paths that are walkable in the Vector layer representing network, which is labelled as Walkable_Road in our project.\nStart Points: Selecting the exit points of the MRT station, which is labelled as TE23_MrtExits.\nSize of Iso-Area: Time-based. For this project, we are study walking times of up to 20 minutes, which is equal to 1200 seconds.\nContour Interval: Time-based. For the purpose of our analysis, we are using time intervals of 5 mins, which is equal to 300 seconds.\nPath type to calculate: Fastest Path (time optimization).\nSetting the Default Speed as 4.44km/h, which is the average walking speed that we found in our literature review.\n\n\nThis is the result of the Iso-area generated with the Fastest path algorithm which is based on our walking speed.\n\n\nNow, we go to Symbology and classify each ring into an interval of 5 minutes, from 0 to 20 mins walking time. The red being the nearest to the MRT exit, and light yellow being the furthest.\nWe repeated these steps for each set of exit points from TE24 to TE29.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we opened the Master Plan 2019 Land Use KML file.\n\n\nThe land use layer will look like this.\n\n\n\nWe proceeded to save it as a Geopackage file with the name “MP19_LandUse” with the appropriate Coordinate Reference System (EPSG:3414).\n\n\nToggle on the Iso-area layer and the land use area. We will be selecting the land use that intersects with the iso-area.\n\n\nGo to the QGIS header bar and find the Select by location function.\n\nSteps: \n\nIn the Select features from column, we will choose our land use layer, which is labelled as MP19_Landuse. \nCheck the box beside intersect, to get the intersection between the land use layer and the iso-area.\nBy comparing selection by: IsoArea_TE23, which is the label for our iso-area.\nWe kept everything else as their default option and ran the selection.\n\n\nThis will be the output generated, the image above shows TE23_Landuse map.\n\nAs shown in above image, we will classify the land use based on the standardised legend our team agreed on. The colours are set to be the natural colour of the landmark to make it more intuitive. Followed by saving it in a styling file.\n\nRepeat the same steps for TE24 to TE29 landuse maps.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we opened the buildings shapefile from OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe buildings shapefile will look like this, which includes all buildings that are located in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. We are only interested in the buildings that are located in Singapore.\n\n\nWe did a selection using the Select Features by Polygon function and selected the buildings that are within the boundaries of mainland Singapore.\n\nWe proceeded to save it as a GeoPackage file with the label All_buildings.\n\n’\nBy utilising the realcentroid plugin that we downloaded separately, we were able to generate the centroids of each building. The main difference between this plugin and the built-in centroid generator is that realcentroid generates a point that is internal of a polygon, whereas the built-in one sometimes would generate a point that is external of the building polygon. We decided to use the former instead.\n\nPicture above shows the centroids generated.\n\nWe proceeded to zoom in to the layer to get a closer look at the centroids that are within the Iso-area.\n\nBy utilizing the Select by Location function, we proceeded to select the centroids that intersect with the Iso-area.\n\nWe labelled the selected centroids as BC_TE23 and saved it as a GeoPackage file, with the correct Coordinated Reference System (EPSG:3414).\n\nThe selected centroids are marked as grey in the screenshot above. We did another selection of the buildings which intersects with the selected centroids.\n\nScreenshot above shows the layers that are included to do this selection.\n\nAs we can see, the selected buildings are highlighted in yellow. It includes the buildings which are partly located outside the iso-area, but have their centroids located inside the Io-area.\n\n\nWe saved these highlighted buildings as TE23_Buildings in a GeoPackage with the correct CRS.\n\nScreenshot above shows the final result after everything is saved.\nWe followed these similar steps from TE24 to TE29.\n\n\n\n\nWe identified many null values in the attribute tables of the buildings. For example, in the picture above of TE24 buildings layer, all the pink buildings are null values. In order to fill up the null values, we placed the buildings layer over the OpenStreetMap view and compared the buildings. Some building were not identifiable through the OpenStreetMap so we took to Google to find out the specific building if it was unclear from the OpenStreetMap.\n\nWe used the Select features by freehand function to select the buildings we identified through the OpenStreetMap. \n\nUsing the Field calculator, we updated the existing field to change the null values to the appropriate categories. However, due to the large number of null values, we were unable to identify each and every building and only focused on the large areas with many null values. We also focused on picking out the buildings that would be beneficial for the residents in the area to have knowledge about such as the schools and religious places.\n\nWe then categorised the buildings based on colours and used the same style for each map.\n\nScreenshot above shows the final result after categorising the buildings.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we imported the places of interest point layer (which is labelled as POIS) into our QGIS project.\n\nScreenshot above shows the POIS layer in its raw form.\n\nWe then proceeded to select the places of interest which are located within mainland Singapore. We did this using the Select Features by Polygon function.\n\nWe then proceeded to save the selected features as a GeoPackage and assigned the appropriate CRS to the file.\n\nBy overlaying the iso-area over the map, we can see the points that are internal and external of the iso-area. We want to extract all the points of interest that are internal of the iso-area.\n\nBy using the Select by Location function, we selected all the points of interest that intersect with the iso-area.\n\nAfter these points of interest are selected, we then saved these selected features in a GeoPackage with the name “TE23_Pois”, indicating the points of interest that are within the iso-area of TE23 (Tanjong Rhu).\n\nScreenshot above shows the result of our selection.\n\n\n\n\nWe then did a classification of these points of interest by their class (named as fclass) and assigned appropriate SVG symbols to these points. The assigning of SVG symbols were based on what the fclass is (if fclass is cafe, we assigned a logo representing a coffee cup to it).\n\nScreenshot above shows the final result of our classification and assigning of SVG symbols.\nWe proceeded to execute similar steps for all iso-areas from TE24 to TE29.\n\n\n\nConsistency of the colours, legends and classification of our iso-areas, places of interest, buildings and land use across all MRT stations is key for intuitive understanding of our maps. Yet, it is a tedious process which requires some special tools for us to standardise the colours. Enter QGIS QML style file!\n\nScreenshot above shows the iso-area after symbolisation is done. How do we implement these exact colours across all iso-areas?\n\nFirstly, we opened the Properties dialog window of the iso-area.\n\nNext, we selected the Style drop-down menu and selected Save Style.\n\nWe named it according to what we are saving (in this case, an iso-area) and saved it as a QML file. \n\nWe left it in its default settings (all boxes checked) and clicked OK.\n\nScreenshot above shows another iso-area which hasn’t been symbolised yet. Now, we want to load the qml file that we just saved to this specific iso-area.\n\n\nFirstly, we opened the properties window, clicked on the Style drop-down menu and selected Load Style.\n\nWe proceeded to import the QML file that we just created (in this case, it is labelled as ISOArea_Symbology) and loaded it into this iso-area.\n\nScreenshot above shows the result after the QML file is loaded.\nWe proceeded to execute the same steps for each iso-area, each set of POIS, buildings and land-use from TE24 to TE29."
