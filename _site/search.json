    "text": "Coast project under the module SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning by Professor Kam Tin Seong in Singapore Managament University (SMU).\nThe name cost of coast came about because we were pondering if the cost of building the stage 4 of TEL MRT stations, is worth it and reap enough benefits for the commuters and residence around the area.\n\n\nWith over 148 km of rail across 106 stations and an estimated 3 million commuters. First open to passengers in 1987, the MRT had actually been a long time coming, with planning done as early as the 1960s. The main objective of building the MRT was to have a better road network for Singaporeans and create a more efficient public transport system to cope with the increasing population. \nIn 1972, consultants and officers started the SG Mass Transit study, in which they recommended an investment in public transport to cope with the travel demands and avoid traffic congestion as it started to worsen. In the second phase, they recommended a bus-rail system rather than an all-bus system. However, it was a dilemma because constructing an MRT system had high costs, impacts on land use and economic activities. In 1982, the government found that SG would benefit greatly from an MRT system and decided to build and finance the $5 billion project.\nMain objectives for building MRT in the past\n\nCope with increasing population\nEase traffic congestion\nBetter road network\n\nThe main objectives for building the TEL:\n\nto “bring residents in the east and along the North-South Corridor closer to a train station and hence giving them faster & more direct access to the city”, as per lta.gov.sg.\nWhen the TEL opens over the next few years, more than 240,000 households will be within a 10-minute walk from a TEL station\nTEL will transport an initial amount of 500,000 commuters, gradually increasing to 1 million commuters in the future.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s, the main objective of building MRT was to have a better road network and an efficient public transport system for Singaporeans to cope with the increasing population. After much progress in the development of the rail-way system today,the Government announced a $87.5 billion in 2020to fund rail-way projects in the next decade, with the Thomson- East Coast line completed and running by 2023. Main objective is to \"bring residents in the east and along the North-South Corridor closer to a train station and hence giving them faster & more direct access to the city\" (lta.gov.sg). However, constructing a MRT system had high cost, impacts on land use and structural integrity of the buildings around it.\n\n\n\nThis project aims to find out what facilities and land use plans are covered within the catchment areas of the 7 upcoming TEL MRT stations and whether there is true necessity to invest such a huge sum into Singapore’s already world-renowned rail system.\n\n\n\n\nThomson East coast line, TE23 Tanjong Rhu to TE29 Bayshore.\n\n\n\n\nTo find out how accessible MRT stations are from residential, commercial and educational institutions.\nHow long does it take to reach the MRT stations, in terms of walking speeds (first mile vs last mile)?\nWhat is the socio-economic profile of residents residing along the TEL?\n\n\n\n\nGenerating of Iso-Areas as Polygons\nIn order to find the area that is within 5- 20 minutes of walking distance, we use the Iso-Area as Polygons Plugin. We did external research to gather information on the average walking speed of Singaporeans which is 4.4km/h, which we used as the speed to generate the Iso-Areas.\nUsing the Roads shapefile from Geofabrik OpenStreetMap, we filtered out all the walkable roads. Using this as our network layer, we are able to generate the Iso-Areas of the walking distance.\nPrimary Catchment Area Analysis (Walking distance)\nWe split our analysis based on three different datasets, Buildings and POIS layer from Geofabrik OpenStreetMap and Master Plan Land use of 2019. We chose these two main datasets as we wanted to look at the current land use as well as the future land use: \n\nBuildings layer: Give us an idea about what kind of services and amenities are currently in the catchment area\nThe Master Plan Land Use layer: The future plans for these catchment areas and who else would the MRT potentially serve by the end of 2024. \nPOIS layer: Get to know what kind of additional services there are.\n\nFor both datasets,we delineated both maps using the Select by Location function to filter out only features that were within the Iso-Areas. As the buildings layer was irregularly shaped, we generated the centroids of the buildings instead to pick out the buildings in the Iso-area with greater ease.\nSecondary Analysis (Cycling Distance)\nAs extra analysis, we generated the cycling time as well. The main difference of this Iso-Area is the speed we used, changing it to 16km/h.\nWe chose two MRT stations for this analysis:\n\nTE25: Major residential area with many schools and different kind of landuse. Analysis on the cycling distance will allow us to learn more about what other facilities are accessible to residents staying further away.\nTE28: From the initial analysis, we could tell that based on walking distance, it was only accessible for people that stayed in landed properties, hence we wanted to know whether taking cycling into consideration, could this MRT station reach a wider population that stays in other kinds of properties such as HDBs.\n\n\n\n\nTeam 10 Gantt Chart"

This dataset gives us the locations of the MRT stations that are estimated to be done by 2023.\nMaster Plan 2019 Land Use from data.gov.sg. This dataset shows the projected land use of Singapore until 2023.\nRoads, buildings and places of interest data (labelled as POIS) from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets, downloaded from Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei which is located in the Geofabrik download server.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data we have retrieved from data.gov.sg, we were able to obtain the shapefile for the MRT stations (existing and future stations). Using the Select features function, we filtered out only the 7 MRT stations of the Thomson-East Coast line that we will be analysing. All the selected stations were saved into a Geopackage, TEL_MRTStations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step we did was to map out the MRT station exits. This data could not be found online. The only dataset that was provided on data.gov.sg was the Master Plan 2019 Rail Station layer, which showed the indicative MRT station outlines. However, we felt that the outlines were not enough to give us accurate results since one MRT station can have up to five different exits which may serve very different purposes. Hence, by creating a new shapefile, we toggled editing and marked out the location of the MRT exits. We referenced lta.gov.sg to obtain the location of the exits of each station. We then created new shapefile layers of point geometry type and toggled editing to add in the point features where the MRT exits are located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our project only focuses on the immediate catchment area of each station, we were only concerned with the areas within 20 minutes of walking distance. Hence, we extracted all the roads that allowed users to walk on. We had to exclude expressways by filtering out Motorway, Motorway Links, Truckway and Truckway links. After extracting out the roads, we created a new layer to form our network layer and ensure all the roads we linked.\n\nSelect the osm_roads_free_1.shp from your file\n\nAfter the layer is loaded, select “select Features by Polygon” from the header.\n\nCrop out the designated area of Singapore, to reduce processing power.\n\nSave the layer in a Geopackage named SG Roads.\n\n\nUsing the expression above, we selected motorway, motorway_link, trunk and trunk_link from osm roads (which are expressways), which are the paths that pedestrians cannot walk on.\n\nWe proceeded to invert the features selected from above. The remaining paths will form the roads with walking paths available, thus making it an important aspect of our catchment area study.\n\nScreenshot above shows all the walking paths in Singapore that are applicable to our study.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we will use TE23 (Tanjong Rhu) MRT station as an example for the methods used to generate iso-areas. The blue pointers indicate the exit points of the station and the lines surrounding it indicate the walking paths.\n\nGo to Processing toolbox -> QNEAT 3 -> select Iso-Area as Polygons (from layer).\n\n\nSteps taken in the screenshots above:\n\nSelecting the paths that are walkable in the Vector layer representing network, which is labelled as Walkable_Road in our project.\nStart Points: Selecting the exit points of the MRT station, which is labelled as TE23_MrtExits.\nSize of Iso-Area: Time-based. For this project, we are study walking times of up to 20 minutes, which is equal to 1200 seconds.\nContour Interval: Time-based. For the purpose of our analysis, we are using time intervals of 5 mins, which is equal to 300 seconds.\nPath type to calculate: Fastest Path (time optimization).\nSetting the Default Speed as 4.44km/h, which is the average walking speed that we found in our literature review.\n\n\nThis is the result of the Iso-area generated with the Fastest path algorithm which is based on our walking speed.\n\n\nNow, we go to Symbology and classify each ring into an interval of 5 minutes, from 0 to 20 mins walking time. The red being the nearest to the MRT exit, and light yellow being the furthest.\nWe repeated these steps for each set of exit points from TE24 to TE29.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we opened the Master Plan 2019 Land Use KML file.\n\n\nThe land use layer will look like this.\n\n\n\nWe proceeded to save it as a Geopackage file with the name “MP19_LandUse” with the appropriate Coordinate Reference System (EPSG:3414).\n\n\nToggle on the Iso-area layer and the land use area. We will be selecting the land use that intersects with the iso-area.\n\n\nGo to the QGIS header bar and find the Select by location function.\n\nSteps: \n\nIn the Select features from column, we will choose our land use layer, which is labelled as MP19_Landuse. \nCheck the box beside intersect, to get the intersection between the land use layer and the iso-area.\nBy comparing selection by: IsoArea_TE23, which is the label for our iso-area.\nWe kept everything else as their default option and ran the selection.\n\n\nThis will be the output generated, the image above shows TE23_Landuse map.\n\nAs shown in above image, we will classify the land use based on the standardised legend our team agreed on. The colours are set to be the natural colour of the landmark to make it more intuitive. Followed by saving it in a styling file.\n\nRepeat the same steps for TE24 to TE29 landuse maps.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we opened the buildings shapefile from OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe buildings shapefile will look like this, which includes all buildings that are located in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. We are only interested in the buildings that are located in Singapore.\n\n\nWe did a selection using the Select Features by Polygon function and selected the buildings that are within the boundaries of mainland Singapore.\n\nWe proceeded to save it as a GeoPackage file with the label All_buildings.\n\n’\nBy utilising the realcentroid plugin that we downloaded separately, we were able to generate the centroids of each building. The main difference between this plugin and the built-in centroid generator is that realcentroid generates a point that is internal of a polygon, whereas the built-in one sometimes would generate a point that is external of the building polygon. We decided to use the former instead.\n\nPicture above shows the centroids generated.\n\nWe proceeded to zoom in to the layer to get a closer look at the centroids that are within the Iso-area.\n\nBy utilizing the Select by Location function, we proceeded to select the centroids that intersect with the Iso-area.\n\nWe labelled the selected centroids as BC_TE23 and saved it as a GeoPackage file, with the correct Coordinated Reference System (EPSG:3414).\n\nThe selected centroids are marked as grey in the screenshot above. We did another selection of the buildings which intersects with the selected centroids.\n\nScreenshot above shows the layers that are included to do this selection.\n\nAs we can see, the selected buildings are highlighted in yellow. It includes the buildings which are partly located outside the iso-area, but have their centroids located inside the Io-area.\n\n\nWe saved these highlighted buildings as TE23_Buildings in a GeoPackage with the correct CRS.\n\nScreenshot above shows the final result after everything is saved.\nWe followed these similar steps from TE24 to TE29.\n\n\n\n\nWe identified many null values in the attribute tables of the buildings. For example, in the picture above of TE24 buildings layer, all the pink buildings are null values. In order to fill up the null values, we placed the buildings layer over the OpenStreetMap view and compared the buildings. Some building were not identifiable through the OpenStreetMap so we took to Google to find out the specific building if it was unclear from the OpenStreetMap.\n\nWe used the Select features by freehand function to select the buildings we identified through the OpenStreetMap. \n\nUsing the Field calculator, we updated the existing field to change the null values to the appropriate categories. However, due to the large number of null values, we were unable to identify each and every building and only focused on the large areas with many null values. We also focused on picking out the buildings that would be beneficial for the residents in the area to have knowledge about such as the schools and religious places.\n\nWe then categorised the buildings based on colours and used the same style for each map.\n\nScreenshot above shows the final result after categorising the buildings.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we imported the places of interest point layer (which is labelled as POIS) into our QGIS project.\n\nScreenshot above shows the POIS layer in its raw form.\n\nWe then proceeded to select the places of interest which are located within mainland Singapore. We did this using the Select Features by Polygon function.\n\nWe then proceeded to save the selected features as a GeoPackage and assigned the appropriate CRS to the file.\n\nBy overlaying the iso-area over the map, we can see the points that are internal and external of the iso-area. We want to extract all the points of interest that are internal of the iso-area.\n\nBy using the Select by Location function, we selected all the points of interest that intersect with the iso-area.\n\nAfter these points of interest are selected, we then saved these selected features in a GeoPackage with the name “TE23_Pois”, indicating the points of interest that are within the iso-area of TE23 (Tanjong Rhu).\n\nScreenshot above shows the result of our selection.\n\n\n\n\nWe then did a classification of these points of interest by their class (named as fclass) and assigned appropriate SVG symbols to these points. The assigning of SVG symbols were based on what the fclass is (if fclass is cafe, we assigned a logo representing a coffee cup to it).\n\nScreenshot above shows the final result of our classification and assigning of SVG symbols.\nWe proceeded to execute similar steps for all iso-areas from TE24 to TE29.\n\n\n\nConsistency of the colours, legends and classification of our iso-areas, places of interest, buildings and land use across all MRT stations is key for intuitive understanding of our maps. Yet, it is a tedious process which requires some special tools for us to standardise the colours. Enter QGIS QML style file!\n\nScreenshot above shows the iso-area after symbolisation is done. How do we implement these exact colours across all iso-areas?\n\nFirstly, we opened the Properties dialog window of the iso-area.\n\nNext, we selected the Style drop-down menu and selected Save Style.\n\nWe named it according to what we are saving (in this case, an iso-area) and saved it as a QML file. \n\nWe left it in its default settings (all boxes checked) and clicked OK.\n\nScreenshot above shows another iso-area which hasn’t been symbolised yet. Now, we want to load the qml file that we just saved to this specific iso-area.\n\n\nFirstly, we opened the properties window, clicked on the Style drop-down menu and selected Load Style.\n\nWe proceeded to import the QML file that we just created (in this case, it is labelled as ISOArea_Symbology) and loaded it into this iso-area.\n\nScreenshot above shows the result after the QML file is loaded.\nWe proceeded to execute the same steps for each iso-area, each set of POIS, buildings and land-use from TE24 to TE29."

    "text": "Analysis on Cycling Paths to & from TE25 and TE28\nApart from our analysis on walking paths, we have also decided to include our analysis on cycling paths, and the overall time needed to get to the MRT stations from different places. We have decided to include these analyses on the back of cycling's growing popularity in Singapore and LTA's intention to encourage it as a viable option for first and last-mile commutes.\nThe analysis that we will be doing is based on iso-areas of maximum 10 mins cycling time, and we segregated the iso-area into 2 intervals: the inner area delineates cycling time of 0-5 minutes and the outer area delineates cycling time of 5-10 minutes. We also set the cycling speed at 16 km/h, which is based on an estimation gathered from multiple sources.\n\nDisclaimer: the area may vary greatly depending on how fast or slow a person cycles.\nOne glance at the maps and they would tell a similar story: if one is able to cycle, then they would find great convenience, both in terms of commuting from the MRT station as well as returning home from the MRT station. A large swathe of residential buildings can be reached well within 5 minutes of the MRT station. If we analyse the MP19 land use map on the right, educational institutions (such as Tanjong Katong Primary & Secondary) can also be reached within 5 minutes as well, down from the previous 15 minutes needed if one were to walk to these institutions. Apart from these benefits, cyclists who wish to go to east coast park in the south can also find it very convenient to hang out there as it is only 5 minutes cycling time away as well. Given that a large area covering this map consists of landed houses, it will be easier for people to return home and park their bikes, saving the need to transport their bikes up and down a HDB block.\nOne downside of this is that we do not have information on how many bike spaces are available for cyclists to park their bikes at these MRT stations, hence it is impossible to know how many people it could benefit. It could potentially be a hindrance for cyclists as well if it transpires that there are not enough bike spaces for cyclists to park their bikes. As a consequence, they may be forced to carry their bikes wherever they go or search for an alternative parking spot. \n\nIf there's ever one map that could encourage workers and employees to cycle more in Siglap, then this map could help them: commercial and business buildings in this area (marked as purple in the map on the right) are all located within 10 minutes cycling time away from Siglap MRT station. It could save them valuable time in their first and last-mile journeys from the MRT to their workplace, and it could also encourage employees who drive to work often to switch to cycling. \nPlaces that needed 20 minutes walking time to reach from MRT station (e.g. Temasek JC, restaurants, cafes, etc) can be reached within 5 minutes by cycling, highlighting the time that can be saved if one cycles to their destination in this area."
